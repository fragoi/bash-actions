#!/bin/bash

## Reads one line from standard input.
## Returns 0 if the line was read, 1 if there are no more lines to read.
## In case the line does not terminate with a newline, an EOF flag is stored.
## When the EOF flag is set no more lines will be read.
## Accepts two optional arguments:
## 1. the name of the variable where the read line is stored. Default to LINE
## 2. the name of the variable where the EOF flag is stored. Default to EOF
## Using the same name for both variables lead to undefined behavior
